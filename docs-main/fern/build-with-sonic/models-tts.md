Cartesia provides a family of state-of-the-art models, including our highly-accurate, low-latency Sonic TTS model family.

- <span style="color: green;">●</span> the latest **stable** snapshot of the model
  {/* - <span style="color: orange;">●</span> the **preview** snapshot (if available) */}

To use the stable version of the model, we recommend using the base model name (e.g. `sonic-2`).
In many cases the stable and preview snapshots are the same, but in some cases the preview snapshot may have additional features or improvements.

## `sonic-2`

Sonic-2 is our most capable text to speech model. It provides ultra-realistic speech with accurate transcript following, minimal hallucinations, and best in class voice cloning. It's latency optimized and achieves 90ms model latency.

Additional Capabilities:

- Higher fidelity voice cloning
- Timestamps for all 15 languages
- [Infill](/api-reference/infill/bytes) support

Note: For versions after `sonic-2-2025-03-07`, `_experimental_controls` is not supported.
If the latest model does not meet your needs, and you would like to use the controls, please make requests to `sonic-2-2025-03-07`.

## `sonic-turbo`

All the power of Sonic, with half the latency (as low as 40ms).

## `sonic`

The first version of our flagship text-to-speech model. It produces high-accuracy, expressive speech, and is optimized for efficiency to achieve low latency.

## Selecting a Model

When making API calls, you can specify either:

```javascript
// Use the base model (automatically routes to the latest snapshot)
const model = "sonic-2";

// Or specify a particular snapshot for consistency
const model = "sonic-2-2025-03-07";
```

### Continuous updates

All models have a base model name (e.g. `sonic-2`, `sonic-turbo`, `sonic`).
We recommend using these for prototyping and development, then switching to a date-versioned model for production use cases to ensure stability.

## Deprecated and Preview Model Aliases

The following model aliases are now deprecated. Please use the recommended model names instead:

| Deprecated Alias     | Use Instead         |
|----------------------|--------------------|
| `sonic-preview`      | `sonic-2`          |
