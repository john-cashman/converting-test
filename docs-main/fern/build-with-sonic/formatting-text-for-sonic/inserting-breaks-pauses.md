title: Inserting Breaks/Pauses
---

To insert breaks (or pauses) in generated speech, you can use `<break />` tags. For example, `<break time="1s" />`. You can specify the time in seconds (`s`) or milliseconds (`ms`). These tags are considered 1 character and do not need to be separated with adjacent text using a space -- to save credits you can remove spaces around break tags. 

## Example

```xml
Hello, my name is Sonic.<break time="1s"/>Nice to meet you.
```
