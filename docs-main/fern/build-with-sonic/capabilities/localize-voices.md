Localization is available in the [playground](https://play.cartesia.ai) and the [API](/api-reference/voices/localize).

Sonic-2 voices have an accent. If you try to use them to generate speech in a different language, they will still have the same accent. For example, if you try to use an American voice to generate speech in Spanish, the resulting Spanish speech will have an American accent.

To get a voice that sounds like a native speaker of the language you're targeting, you can use Sonic-2's localization feature through the API or playground.

The localization feature accepts a voice to localize, the gender of the voice, and the target language and accent to localize to, and produces a Voice that you can use to generate speech (or save as a new voice).
