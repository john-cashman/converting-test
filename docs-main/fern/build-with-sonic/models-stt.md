Ink is a new family of streaming speech-to-text (STT) models for developers building real-time voice applications.

- <span style="color: green;">●</span> the latest **stable** snapshot of the model
  {/* - <span style="color: orange;">●</span> the **preview** snapshot (if available) */}

To use the stable version of the model, we recommend using the base model name (e.g. `ink-whisper`).
In many cases the stable and preview snapshots are the same, but in some cases the preview snapshot may have additional features or improvements.

## `ink-whisper`

Ink Whisper is the fastest, most affordable speech-to-text model — engineered for enterprise deployment in production-grade voice agents. It delivers higher accuracy than baseline Whisper and is optimized for real-time performance in a wide variety of real-world conditions.

Additional Capabilities:

- Handles variable-length audio chunks and interruptions gracefully using dynamic chunking.
- Reliably transcribes speech with background noise.
- Accurately transcribes audio with telephony artifacts, accents, and disfluencies.
- Excels at transcribing proper nouns and domain-specific terminology.

To learn how to use the Ink STT family, see [the Speech-to-Text API Reference](/api-reference/stt/stt).

## Selecting a Model

When making API calls, you can specify either:

```python
// Use the base model (automatically routes to the latest snapshot)
{
  model = "ink-whisper",
  ...
}

// Or specify a particular snapshot for consistency
{
  model = "ink-whisper-2025-06-04",
  ...
}
```

### Continuous updates

All models have a base model name (e.g. `ink-whisper`).
We recommend using these for prototyping and development, then switching to a date-versioned model for production use cases to ensure stability.

## Future Updates

New snapshots are released periodically with improvements in performance, additional language support, and new capabilities. Check back regularly for updates.
