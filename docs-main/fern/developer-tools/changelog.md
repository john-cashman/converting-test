Updates to existing APIs for `sonic-2-2025-04-16`

Starting with `sonic-2-2025-04-16`, we're removing support for:

- Embeddings
- `stability` cloning mode
- Experimental controls for adjusting speed and emotion.

In our latest models, the `similarity` cloning mode is dramatically better than `stability` cloning,
and we've solved the stability issues. Since it's no longer worth using `stability` mode at all,
we've removed it.

The experimental controls for speed and emotion negatively affect model stability in practice. We're
working on adding these controls in future model versions in a way that is more stable and
effective.

To control speed and emotion in Sonic 2.0, we recommend using Instant Voice Cloning to create
new Voices with the modifications you're looking for. For example, you can speed up or slow down
voices with `FFMPEG`, use Voice Changer to create emotive versions of voices, and make instant
clones of voices generated with embeddings on `sonic-2-2025-03-07`.

Users who absolutely need embeddings or experimental controls should use API version `2024-11-13`
with model ID `sonic-2-2025-03-07`, both of which are still available. Please be aware that these
features could lead to reduced model stability even with that model.

Specific API changes:

- `sonic-2` and `sonic-2-2025-04-16` will ignore experimental controls used with TTS generations
- Voice cloning only supports `similarity` clones -- this technique performs the best across-the-board on the `sonic-2` model.
- Removed embeddings from all endpoints.
- Voices may only be specified by Voice ID
  - `/tts` generations cannot be called with voice embeddings
- Deprecated `/voices/create` and `/voices/mix`
