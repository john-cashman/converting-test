### If you want to generate speech in real-time

We recommend using our WebSocket endpoint for real-time applications for a few reasons:

1. **Latency**: You can establish a WebSocket connection in advance, which means that you do not incur any connection latency when you start generating speech. (This usually saves you about 200ms.)
2. **Input Streaming**: You can stream in inputs while maintaining the prosody of the generated speech, which is useful when generating text inputs in real-time, such as with an LLM.
3. **Timestamps**: You can get timestamped transcripts for the generated speech to build features like subtitles or live transcripts. (For the `sonic` model, timestamps are only supported for languages `en`, `de`, `es`, and `fr`. For `sonic-preview`, timestamps are supported for all languages!)
4. **Multiplexing**: You can multiplex multiple conversations over a single connection.

### If you want to generate speech ahead of time

We recommend using our raw bytes (i.e. audio file) output endpoint, which can give you outputs in a variety of formats, such as WAV and MP3 (in addition to raw PCM audio).
