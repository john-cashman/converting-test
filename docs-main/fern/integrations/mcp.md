2. Install the mcp python package

```sh
pip install cartesia-mcp
which cartesia-mcp # absolute path to executable
```

## Client Integration

Add the following to your claude config file which can be found by visiting Claude Settings > Developer > Edit Config. 
**Make sure to restart Claude Desktop.**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cartesia-mcp": {
      "command": "<absolute-path-to-executable>",
      "env": {
