Built on WebRTC, LiveKit is a realtime platform that enables developers to build video, voice, and data capabilities into their applications.

LiveKit Agents is LiveKit's framework for building real-time conversational agents.

Cartesia is available as a [plugin for LiveKit Agents](https://github.com/livekit/agents/tree/main/livekit-plugins/livekit-plugins-cartesia), providing both Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) capabilities for building conversational AI applications.
