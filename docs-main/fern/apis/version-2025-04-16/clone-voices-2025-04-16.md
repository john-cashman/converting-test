Voice cloning is available through the [playground](https://play.cartesia.ai) and the [API](/api-reference/voices/clone). High-similarity clones sound more like the source clip, but may reproduce background noise.

For the best voice clones, we recommend following these best practices:

## General best practices for voice cloning

1. **Choose an appropriate script to speak.** You want your recording to align as closely as possible with the voice you want to generate. For example, don't read a colorless transcript in a monotone voice unless you're aiming for a monotonous clone. Instead, prepare a script that is suited to your use case and has the right energy.
2. **Speak as clearly as possible and avoid background noise.** For example, when recording yourself, try to use a high-quality microphone, be in a quiet space, and so on.
3. **Avoid long pauses in the clip.** Too many long pauses could result in the cloned voice drifting from the source clip.
4. **Speak in the target language.** For instance, if you want the cloned voice to speak Spanish, speak Spanish in the recording. If this is not possible, you can use Cartesia's localization feature—available in the playground and in the API—to convert your clone to a different language.
5. **Limit your recording to ten seconds.** This is the sweet spot for high-similarity clones. A longer clip will not result in a better clone.
6. **Set `enhance` to `false` when cloning.** Unless your source clip has substantial background noise, any postprocessing will reduce the similarity of the clone to the source clip.
