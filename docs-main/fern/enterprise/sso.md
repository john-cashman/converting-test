title: Set up SSO
---

We support Single-Sign On (SSO) for customers on the Enterprise plan via SAML. This integration is processed through our identity provider, [Clerk](https://clerk.com).

## Set up SSO with Okta

1. Send us your SSO domain.
2. We will send you a service provider configuration, which consists of a single-sign on URL and an audience URI (SP entity ID).
3. Follow steps 2, 3, 4, and 5 in [the Clerk SSO guide](https://clerk.com/docs/authentication/enterprise-connections/saml/okta), and send us the metadata URL you get from step 6.1.

After you are done, we will complete the remaining SSO setup and send you a confirmation that SSO is enabled for your organization.
