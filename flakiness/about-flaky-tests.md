# About flaky tests

Navigate the challenge of flaky tests with Argos: Discover strategies to enhance test reliability and promote accessibility for a stable visual testing environment.

## Emphasis on Accessibility

At Argos, we advocate for accessibility-focused end-to-end testing. Enhancing accessibility not only supports users with disabilities but also strengthens test consistency.

## Common Causes

Flakiness often stems from:

- **Dynamic Content**: Flakiness due to content changes, like ads or user-generated content.
- **Asynchronous Loading**: Inconsistent element or style loading affecting visuals.
- **Rendering Differences**: Browser or device variations altering visual output.
- **External Dependencies**: Reliance on external systems causing variability.
- **Animations and Transitions**: Unhandled animations leading to different visual states.
- **Resolution and Scaling**: Screen resolution or scaling differences impacting visuals.

Solutions involve identifying and addressing these root causes.

## Policy

We don't offer a "flaky test ignore" option, aligning with our ethos that addressing issues is preferable to bypassing them.
