# About us

Argos is building the future of visual testing—catching UI regressions before they ship.

Founded by [Greg Bergé](https://x.com/gregberge_) and [Jeremy Sfez](https://x.com/SfezJeremy), Argos is a fast, reliable, and developer-friendly visual testing solution designed for modern frontend teams.

## Our story

Argos started in 2016 as an internal tool at [Doctolib](https://www.doctolib.fr/), where Greg and [Olivier Tassinari](https://twitter.com/olivtassinari) (now CEO of [MUI](https://mui.com/)) were working together. They faced a common challenge: how to ensure that UI changes didn't silently introduce regressions.

After evaluating existing tools and finding none that fit their needs, they decided to build their own. The result was Argos visual testing solution that quickly became essential to Doctolib's development workflow. Screenshots proved faster and more reliable than complex end-to-end tests for detecting visual changes.

As Doctolib grew into France's largest unicorn and MUI became the most widely used React UI library in the world, Argos continued to play a key role behind the scenes, comparing over millions screenshots every month.

In 2022, Greg teamed up with his long-time collaborator [Jeremy Sfez](https://twitter.com/jeremysfez) to bring Argos to the wider developer community. Together, they transformed Argos from an internal tool into a full-fledged SaaS product, focused on ease of use, speed, and powerful CI integrations.

By early 2023, Argos launched on the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/argos-ci) with a self-service onboarding flow. Since then, it's been adopted by more than 80 product teams who use it daily to safeguard their UIs from unintended changes.

## Our vision

We believe that developer experience is essential to building great software. As seasoned developers ourselves, we care deeply about crafting smooth, well-designed tools that elevate both the user experience and the developer journey.

Our mission with Argos is to support fast-moving product teams with resilient end-to-end visual testing without the usual overhead. With Argos, the breadth of your product's test coverage no longer scales with the burden of test maintenance.

We're committed to offering a lightweight, plug-and-play service that improves how modern teams build and ship software.
