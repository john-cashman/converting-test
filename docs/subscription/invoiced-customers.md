# Invoiced customers

Discover how invoiced GitHub accounts affect subscribing to Argos' paid plan and explore alternative subscription options.

If you have a GitHub invoiced account and are looking to subscribe to Argos' paid plan through the GitHub Marketplace, you may have encountered the following error message:

> "Unfortunately, invoiced customers cannot purchase paid plans on the GitHub Marketplace." **â€” GitHub error message**

This error message can be confusing, but it simply means that if your GitHub account is set up to receive an invoice for your subscription rather than charging your credit card directly, you won't be able to use the GitHub Marketplace to subscribe to Argos.

Not to worry! You can still purchase an Argos' paid plan by [subscribing via Stripe](/how-to-subscribe).
