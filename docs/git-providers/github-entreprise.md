# GitHub Enterprise Integration

GitHub Enterprise is a self-hosted version of GitHub that you can deploy on your own servers. It is a great way to keep your code and data secure while still benefiting from the features of GitHub.

To integrate GitHub Enterprise with Argos, you need to create a GitHub App on your GitHub Enterprise instance and provide the required details to Argos.

If you are interested in integrating GitHub Enterprise with Argos, please contact us at [contact@argos-ci.com](mailto:contact@argos-ci.com).
